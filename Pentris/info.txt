Implementation of a variation of the classic game Tetris(1984) in Python.
This game uses Python 3 with the Pygame and the random libraries, thus you need them to run it.
The gameplay works similarly to the classic but instead of using only tetrominos it uses all combinations from the square to the pentominos.
The game is not perfect and has some bugs, be warned.
